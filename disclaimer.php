            Learnora.ng is a platform designed to connect learners with training opportunities across a wide range of subjects. While we strive to ensure that all course content, trainer profiles, and educational materials are accurate, up-to-date, and high-quality, Learnora.ng does not guarantee the absolute accuracy, completeness, or reliability of any content provided by third-party trainers, instructors, or institutions.

<p>It is the responsibility of learners to verify the suitability of courses for their learning goals, and for trainers to ensure the originality and accuracy of the content they provide.
